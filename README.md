## Overview

This pack is designed to expand minecraft 1.12 in a way that is very different than newer versions of minecraft but still feel like minecraft. eg. more biomes, dimensions, blocks, items, tools, weapons, armor, plants etc. with a few backports to round things out.

## Planned Features

New biomes like maple forest, obsidian volcano (modified bop volcano biome)

New dimensions: Luna (the moon), Mars, Titan, Venus and several others. These worlds are inspired by a combination of real NASA photos (the soil and rock) and pulp scifi (Venus is basically a rainy jungle and swamp world with dangerous creatures and new plants)

New tools, armor and weapons: Copper, Tin, Bronze, Steel, Electrum, Silver, Iridium, Meteor Iron, end gems, netherite and emeralds

New potions, potion mugs (breaks potions into shorter duration effects) and honey potions (these can be reversibly stored as blocks like honey can be in later versions of minecraft)

New mobs eg. animals like elephants and pandas, vanilla style hostile mobs like the void eye
