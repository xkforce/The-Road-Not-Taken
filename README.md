# 🌲 The Road Not Taken

*Building blocks, terrain, magic, tools, armor, weapons, music - and a deeper sense of immersion.*

**The Road Not Taken** is a lovingly crafted Minecraft **1.12** modpack that explores a different evolutionary path for the game - one that feels *familiar*, *grounded*, and *distinctly Minecraft*, without chasing the design of newer versions.

## 🌍 Overview

This pack expands Minecraft **1.12** in ways that feel natural to the era, while still dramatically broadening the game's scope.

Expect:

The goal is *depth over spectacle* - evolution, not reinvention.
